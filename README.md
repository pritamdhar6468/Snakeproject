# SnakeProject
<ul>In this article, the task is to implement a basic Snake Game. Below given some functionalities of this game:</li>

<li>The snake is represented with a 0(zero) symbol.</li>
<li>The fruit is represented with an *(asterisk) symbol.</li>
<li>The snake can move in any direction according to the user with the help of the keyboard (W, A, S, D keys).</li>
<li>When the snake eats a fruit the score will increase by 10 points.</li>
<li>The fruit will generate automatically within the boundaries.</li>
  <li>Whenever the snake will touch the boundary the game is over.</li></ul>
<h2>Steps to create this game:</h2>

<ul><li>There will be four user-defined functions.</li>
<li>Build a boundary within which the game will be played.</li>
<li>The fruits are generated randomly.</li>
<li>Then increase the score whenever the snake eats a fruit.</li>
<li>The user-defined functions created in this program are given below:</li>

<li>Draw(): This function creates the boundary in which the game will be played.</li>
<li>Setup(): This function will set the position of the fruit within the boundary.</li>
<li>Input(): This function will take the input from the keyboard.</li>
<li>Logic(): This function will set the movement of the snake.</li></ul>
